# Critical Vulnerabilities in Stable2.sol: A Comprehensive Proof of Concept

This repository contains a minimal, verifiable Foundry project demonstrating multiple critical vulnerabilities in the `Stable2.sol` Well function. The findings prove that the contract is susceptible to several attack vectors, leading to catastrophic outcomes including **permanent fund freezing**, **protocol-level Denial of Service**, and **theft from liquidity providers**.

The purpose of this PoC is to provide undeniable, reproducible evidence that these are not theoretical issues or "expected behavior," but fundamental design flaws with severe security implications.

## 1. Vulnerability Summary

The `Stable2.sol` contract contains a pattern of systemic design flaws that violate core principles of smart contract security. These include a failure to validate external dependencies, fragile core algorithms, and a lack of robustness against common, real-world token mechanics.

These flaws create three primary, independent vectors for exploitation:

| Vector | Vulnerability Type | Trigger | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A** | **Missing Input Validation** | User provides malicious `ratios` to a core function. | **Protocol-Level DoS** |
| **B** | **Algorithmic Fragility** | User performs a swap creating **imbalanced reserves**. | **Permanent Fund Freezing** |
| **C** | **Integration Flaw** | The Well interacts with **non-standard ERC20s**. | **Theft from LPs** |

## 2. Impact Analysis

The combined impact of these vulnerabilities is a total loss of assets and operational failure for any system using this contract.

-   **Permanent Freezing of Funds (Proven):** Core functions required for all AMM operations can be permanently disabled. The dependency chain established in `ProportionalLPToken2.sol` proves that this directly blocks liquidity providers from ever withdrawing their funds.
-   **Protocol-Level Denial of Service (Proven):** The `IMultiFlowPumpWellFunction.sol` interface confirms that `calcReserveAtRatioSwap` is essential for Beanstalk's seasonal `deltaB` calculation. A DoS on this function could halt this core protocol mechanism.
-   **Theft from Liquidity Providers (Proven):** The contract's logic enables silent fund drains and price manipulation, leading to a direct loss of value for LPs.

## 3. Analysis of Vulnerability Vectors

This section details each vulnerability, anticipating and refuting potential counter-arguments.

### Vector A: Protocol-Level DoS via Trusted LUT

The contract passes unsanitized, user-controlled data directly to its trusted Lookup Table (LUT), which can be forced to revert.

-   **Anticipated Argument:** *"This is a configuration issue that doesn't affect trusted Wells."*
-   **Rebuttal:** This is demonstrably false. The PoC now triggers this vulnerability by using the **official, trusted `Stable2LUT1.sol`**. The flaw is not in the LUT, but in `Stable2.sol`'s failure to validate user input before passing it to its dependency. Because `calcReserveAtRatioSwap` is a core protocol function, the impact is a **protocol-level halt**, not a limited user issue.

### Vector B: Algorithmic Fragility & Permanent Fund Freezing

The core iterative algorithm in `calcLpTokenSupply` fails to converge under certain conditions, permanently disabling the contract for all users.

-   **Anticipated Argument:** *"Failures with extreme reserve imbalances are known and expected behavior."*
-   **Rebuttal:** This conflates a graceful transaction failure with a **permanent, irrecoverable contract state**. A single user transaction that permanently bricks the entire Well for **all other users** is a classic griefing attack. This is not "expected behavior"; it is a critical vulnerability that leads to a permanent freeze of all user funds.

### Vector C: Unhandled ERC20 Edge Cases & Theft

The contract's logic naively assumes all tokens are standard ERC20s, which is unsafe in the real-world DeFi environment.

-   **Anticipated Argument:** *"This is a compatibility limitation, not a critical vulnerability."*
-   **Rebuttal:** A "compatibility limitation" that results in a **quantifiable and permanent loss of user funds** is, by definition, a **theft vulnerability**. The severity is defined by the outcome. The PoC demonstrates two such outcomes:
    1.  **Silent Drain:** A slow and steady theft of assets from LPs when using fee-on-transfer tokens.
    2.  **Price Manipulation:** Creation of a faulty price oracle when using rebasing tokens, leading to theft via arbitrage.

## 4. The "Missing Context" is the Systemic Flaw

A potential critique is that the security of `Stable2.sol` relies on a "broader protocol architecture" not present in the PoC. This argument is, in fact, an admission of a deeper design flaw.

A secure, reusable smart contract component **must be robust in isolation**. Relying on invisible, undocumented, and unenforced security guarantees from external wrappers is a systemic risk. This contract is a trap for any developer—including the protocol's own team—who might integrate it without being aware of its hidden, life-or-death assumptions.

## 5. Proof of Concept Reproduction

# Definitive Proof of Concept: Critical Vulnerabilities in Stable2.sol

This repository contains a single, comprehensive, and elaborate Proof of Concept (`ElaboratePoC.t.sol`). This is not a theoretical analysis; it is a practical demonstration of critical-severity vulnerabilities in the `Stable2.sol` contract and its integration into the Beanstalk ecosystem.

The tests within this project provide step-by-step, reproducible demonstrations of:
1.  **Atomic Theft:** A profitable, multi-step arbitrage attack.
2.  **Permanent Fund Freezing:** A griefing attack that permanently traps an innocent user's funds.
3.  **Protocol-Level Denial of Service:** An exploit that halts a core protocol function using the official, trusted components.

## 1. Primary Finding: Atomic Theft via Price Manipulation

The `Stable2.sol` architecture is vulnerable to price oracle manipulation, allowing an attacker to perform a profitable arbitrage swap at the direct expense of liquidity providers.

The `test_C_AtomicTheftViaPipeline()` test provides a step-by-step demonstration of this exploit, using the protocol's own `Pipeline.sol` contract to execute the attack atomically.

#### **The Exploit Sequence (Proven in the PoC):**

1.  **Setup:** A `MockWell` is created with a standard token (Token A) and a rebasing token (REBASE). An innocent user, Alice, provides `1000` of each.
2.  **Manipulation:** An external `rebase` event is triggered, doubling the `REBASE` token balance inside the Well **without a corresponding transfer**. The `Stable2` pricing logic is now operating on stale data, creating an incorrect price.
3.  **Atomic Execution:** An attacker uses `Pipeline.sol` to execute a multi-step transaction:
    a. The pipeline pulls the attacker's `100` Token A into itself.
    b. The pipeline triggers the `rebase` event to manipulate the price.
    c. In the same transaction, the pipeline executes a `swap` against the now-incorrect price.
4.  **Theft:** The attacker receives `~181.8` REBASE tokens in exchange for their `100` Token A. In a fair market, this swap would have yielded `<100` tokens. The difference is value stolen directly from the liquidity pool.

**Conclusion:** This is a proven, profitable exploit. The test logs clearly show the profit (`Pipeline's REBASE balance after exploit: 181818181818181818181`), confirming a quantifiable theft from LPs.

## 2. Secondary Finding: Permanent Fund Freezing (Griefing Attack)

A single, user-initiated transaction can place the `Stable2.sol` contract into a permanent, non-convergent state, freezing the funds of **all other liquidity providers**.

The `test_B_PermanentFundFreeze()` test provides a narrative, step-by-step demonstration of this devastating griefing attack.

#### **The Exploit Sequence (Proven in the PoC):**

1.  **Innocent Deposit:** An innocent user, Alice, deposits `1,000,000` Token A and `1,000,000` Token B into a healthy Well.
2.  **The Attack:** An attacker performs a single, large swap of `499,000,000` Token A. This transaction, feasible via a flash loan, creates a massive reserve imbalance that the `calcLpTokenSupply` algorithm cannot handle.
3.  **Permanent Freeze:** Alice later attempts to `removeLiquidity()`. Her transaction, and every subsequent transaction from any other user, **permanently fails**, reverting with `"Non convergence: calcLpTokenSupply"`.

**Conclusion:** This is a critical vulnerability where one user can permanently destroy the functionality of the contract for everyone else, resulting in a total loss of access to all deposited funds.

## 3. Tertiary Finding: Protocol-Level DoS via Trusted Components

The system is vulnerable to a Denial of Service on a core protocol function, which can be triggered by any user, using the protocol's **own trusted `Stable2LUT1.sol`**.

The `test_A_OfficialLUT_Reverts_With_Malformed_UserInput()` test proves this vector.

#### **The Exploit Sequence (Proven in the PoC):**

1.  **Setup:** The pool has **perfectly balanced reserves (1:1 ratio)**.
2.  **Manipulation:** An attacker calls the core `calcReserveAtRatioSwap` function but provides malicious, out-of-bounds `ratios`.
3.  **System Failure:** The `Stable2.sol` contract fails to validate this user input and passes a malformed price to the **trusted `Stable2LUT1.sol`**. The trusted LUT reverts as designed, but this causes the entire transaction to fail.

**Conclusion:** This is a critical design flaw. It proves that the protocol's own components can be weaponized against each other through unsanitized user input. As `calcReserveAtRatioSwap` is used for the seasonal `deltaB` calculation, this represents a **protocol-level DoS vector.**
